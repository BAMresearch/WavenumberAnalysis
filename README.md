# WavenumberAnalysis
This project allows to perform wavenumber mapping for an input image with an ultrasonic wavefield using Matlab. A wavenumber map shows the local wavenumber in each point and can be used to detect defects.

Run Script_example_ThicknessMap.m for the example in [1].

Run Script_test_WavenumberMap_1D.m for a 1d-analytical test case.

Run Script_test_WavenumberMap_2D.m for a 2d-analytical test case.
